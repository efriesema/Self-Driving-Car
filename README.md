# Self-Driving-Car
Using Python and Kivy to create simple road maps which will then train an  car-model to navigate through the road map you create through the application of reinforcement learning.  This was a project based on the Udemy Artificial Intelligence online course

The simple idea was to use Kivy to allow the user to paint any road map on the screen.  Then the car would attempt to traverse from the upper-left to lower right corner avoiding any yellow road edges marked out on the map. with the excpetion of very drastic Aand curvy road maps the car does a very good job of learning the corect route after a few attempts.  


The vo files were the original source projects but i rewrote and modified my own to adjust the algorithm. PyTorch was the neural network Library used,  Kivy was used to create the GUI elements.  The reinforcment LEarning was created based on a Deep Q-Learning model with experience Replay
